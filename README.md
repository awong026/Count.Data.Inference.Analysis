## Objective
Question 1: Nuclear Mishap. n = 150. Queston: "Should there have been a full evacuation of the immediaate area?"
Test whether the distance from the accident and evacuation attitudes are associated.

Question 2: 700 women's birthday's Are the Birthday's spread uniformly? (homogenatility)

## Summary
Question 1: Created a matrix with data given, then ran a chi-squared test

Question 2: Created a matrix with data given, then ran a chi-squared test
## Conclusion
Question 1: Used chi-square test to whether the distance from the accident and evacuation attitudes are associated. 
I got a  p value of .9939 which means we can't reject null that accident and evacuation attitudes are independent. 

Question 2: 
Used chi-square test to check for homogeneity in number of birthdays by month for the 700 women who gave birth at the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland. Pvalue is .04925, which means  we reject that birthday count  is spread uniformly at alpha = .05.
